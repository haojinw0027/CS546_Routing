            "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking for the sum of all integer bases b > 9 where 17_b divides 97_b. Hmm. Alright, first I need to understand what these numbers represent in base b. \n\nSo, 17 in base b is equal to 1*b + 7. Similarly, 97 in base b is 9*b + 7. The question is saying that 1*b + 7 divides 9*b + 7. So, mathematically, we need (b + 7) divides (9b + 7). \n\nLet me write that down: (b + 7) | (9b + 7). To find when this divisibility holds, I can use the concept that if a divides b, then a divides b - k*a for any integer k. So maybe I can subtract a multiple of (b + 7) from (9b + 7) to simplify.\n\nLet me compute 9b + 7 minus 9*(b + 7). That would be 9b + 7 - 9b - 63 = -56. So, (b + 7) divides -56. But since divisors can be positive or negative, but in terms of absolute value, (b + 7) must divide 56. \n\nWait, but since b > 9, then b + 7 is definitely positive. So, (b + 7) must be a positive divisor of 56. Therefore, the possible values of b + 7 are the divisors of 56 that are greater than 9 + 7 = 16. Wait, no. Wait, b > 9, so b + 7 > 9 + 7 = 16. Therefore, b + 7 must be a divisor of 56 that is greater than 16. \n\nLet me list the positive divisors of 56. 56 factors into 2^3 * 7. So the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. Now, which of these are greater than 16? 28 and 56. So, b + 7 can be 28 or 56. Therefore, solving for b: \n\nIf b + 7 = 28, then b = 21. \n\nIf b + 7 = 56, then b = 49. \n\nSo the possible bases are 21 and 49. Then the sum is 21 + 49 = 70. \n\nWait, but I should check if these bases are valid. For example, in base b, the digits must be less than b. The numbers 17_b and 97_b have digits 1,7 and 9,7. So in base b, the digits must be valid. Since b > 9, the digit 9 is allowed. So for b=21 and 49, digits 9 and 7 are valid. So both are valid bases. \n\nTherefore, the sum is 21 + 49 = 70. \n\nLet me double-check the divisibility. For b=21: 17_b is 21 +7=28. 97_b is 9*21 +7=189 +7=196. 196 divided by 28 is 7. So yes, 28 divides 196. \n\nFor b=49: 17_b is 49 +7=56. 97_b is 9*49 +7=441 +7=448. 448 divided by 56 is 8. So yes, 56 divides 448. \n\nSo both bases are valid. Therefore, the answer is 70.\n</think>\n\n1. **Evaluated Difficulty of Questions**: 6\n2. **Evidence of Difficulty Evaluation of Questions**: The level of difficulty is intermediate because it requires understanding base conversions, divisibility rules, and solving for integer constraints. The problem combines arithmetic reasoning with algebraic manipulation of divisibility conditions.\n3. **Calibrate Explicit Reasoning Steps**: (1) Convert $17_b$ and $97_b$ to base 10: $b + 7$ and $9b + 7$. (2) Use divisibility condition: $b + 7 \\mid 9b + 7$. (3) Simplify by subtracting $9(b + 7)$ from $9b + 7$ to get $-56$, so $b + 7 \\mid 56$. (4) Find divisors of 56 greater than $16$ (since $b > 9$): $28, 56$. (5) Solve $b + 7 = 28 \\Rightarrow b = 21$, $b + 7 = 56 \\Rightarrow b = 49$.

            "ground_truth": "49",
            "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is to find the sum of all positive integers n such that n + 2 divides the product 3(n + 3)(n² + 9). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for n + 2 to divide that product. So, mathematically, this means that when we divide 3(n + 3)(n² + 9) by n + 2, there should be no remainder. In other words, 3(n + 3)(n² + 9) mod (n + 2) should be zero.\n\nMaybe I can use polynomial division or the Remainder Theorem here. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial f(n) divided by (n - a) is f(a). But here, the divisor is (n + 2), which is like (n - (-2)). So if I consider f(n) = 3(n + 3)(n² + 9), then the remainder when divided by (n + 2) is f(-2). For the division to have no remainder, this remainder must be zero.\n\nLet me compute f(-2):\n\nFirst, calculate each part:\nn + 3 when n = -2 is (-2) + 3 = 1.\nn² + 9 when n = -2 is (-2)² + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13.\nMultiply them together with the 3: 3 * 1 * 13 = 39.\n\nSo, the remainder is 39. Therefore, for n + 2 to divide the product, 39 must be divisible by n + 2. That means n + 2 is a positive divisor of 39. But since n is a positive integer, n + 2 must be at least 3 (since n ≥ 1). However, divisors of 39 can be both positive and negative, but since n + 2 is positive (as n is positive), we only consider positive divisors.\n\nThe positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. But n + 2 must be at least 3, so possible divisors are 3, 13, 39. Therefore, n + 2 can be 3, 13, or 39. Solving for n:\n\nIf n + 2 = 3 → n = 1\nIf n + 2 = 13 → n = 11\nIf n + 2 = 39 → n = 37\n\nWait, but hold on. Are these all the possible divisors? Let me check. 39 factors into 3 * 13, so the divisors are indeed 1, 3, 13, 39. Since n + 2 must be greater than or equal to 3 (as n ≥ 1), those three divisors are the only possibilities. Therefore, the possible n are 1, 11, 37. \n\nBut wait, I need to verify each of these values to ensure that they actually satisfy the original condition. Sometimes when using the Remainder Theorem, there might be cases where even though the remainder is zero, there could be other factors, but in this case, since we directly set the remainder to zero, it should hold. However, to be thorough, let me check each n:\n\nFor n = 1:\nn + 2 = 3. The product is 3*(1 + 3)*(1² + 9) = 3*4*10 = 120. 120 divided by 3 is 40, which is an integer. So yes, 3 divides 120.\n\nFor n = 11:\nn + 2 = 13. The product is 3*(11 + 3)*(11² + 9) = 3*14*(121 + 9) = 3*14*130. Let's compute 3*14 = 42, 42*130 = 5460. Divided by 13: 5460 /13 = 420. Which is an integer.\n\nFor n = 37:\nn + 2 = 39. The product is 3*(37 + 3)*(37² + 9) = 3*40*(1369 + 9) = 3*40*1378. Let's compute 3*40 = 120, 120*1378. Let me check if 1378 divided by 39 gives an integer? Wait, but the entire product divided by 39 should be an integer. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, since we know from our earlier step that the remainder is zero, so 39 divides the product. But just to confirm:\n\nThe product is 3*(40)*(1378). Since 39 divides this, and 39 is 3*13. The 3 in the product cancels with the 3 in 39, leaving 13. So 40*1378 must be divisible by 13. Let's check 1378 divided by 13: 13*106 = 1378 (since 13*100=1300, 13*6=78, so 1300+78=1378). Therefore, 40*1378 = 40*13*106, which is clearly divisible by 13. Hence, the entire product is divisible by 39. So n=37 is valid.\n\nAre there any other divisors? Let me check if I missed any. The positive divisors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. Since n is positive, n + 2 can't be 1 because that would make n = -1, which is not positive. So the only possible n are 1, 11, 37. Therefore, the sum is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"positive integers n\", so n must be at least 1. Therefore, n + 2 is at least 3, which we considered. But what if there are other divisors? Let me check 39's divisors again. 39 is 3*13, so the divisors are indeed 1, 3, 13, 39. So no others. So the answer is 1 + 11 + 37 = 49.\n\nBut wait, I just thought—could there be cases where n + 2 divides the product even if the remainder isn't zero? Wait, no. Because the Remainder Theorem says that the remainder when dividing by n + 2 is f(-2) = 39. Therefore, for the division to be exact, the remainder must be zero, so 39 must be divisible by n + 2. Therefore, n + 2 must be a divisor of 39. Hence, all possible divisors have been considered. Therefore, the answer is 49.\n</think>\n\n1. **Evaluated Difficulty of Questions**: 6  \n2. **Evidence of Difficulty Evaluation of Questions**: The level of difficulty is **intermediate** because it requires applying the Remainder Theorem to a polynomial, identifying divisors of a number, and verifying solutions, which involves multiple logical steps and mathematical concepts.  \n3. **Calibrate Explicit Reasoning Steps**: (1) Use the Remainder Theorem: For $ n + 2 $ to divide $ 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) $, substitute $ n = -2 $ into the polynomial to find the remainder.

            "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have six points A, B, C, D, E, F on a straight line in that order. There's a point G not on the line. We're given several distances between these points and from G to some of them. The goal is to find the area of triangle BGE.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the problem. All points A-F are colinear, and G is somewhere off that line. The distances given are AC, BD, CE, DF, AF, CG, and DG. The area of triangle BGE depends on the coordinates of B, G, and E. Since the points are on a line, maybe we can assign coordinates to them and then find coordinates for G using the given distances. Then, use coordinates to compute the area.\n\nLet me start by assigning coordinates to the points on the line. Let's assume the line is the x-axis for simplicity. Let me denote the coordinates of A, B, C, D, E, F as a, b, c, d, e, f respectively. Since they are in order, we have a < b < c < d < e < f.\n\nWe are given:\n\nAC = 26: So c - a = 26.\n\nBD = 22: d - b = 22.\n\nCE = 31: e - c = 31.\n\nDF = 33: f - d = 33.\n\nAF = 73: f - a = 73.\n\nAlso, CG = 40 and DG = 30. Since G is not on the line, we need coordinates for G. Let's denote G as (x, y), where y ≠ 0.\n\nBut how do we relate CG and DG? Since C and D are points on the line, their coordinates are c and d. The distance from G to C is sqrt((x - c)^2 + y^2) = 40, and similarly for DG: sqrt((x - d)^2 + y^2) = 30.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n(x - c)^2 + y^2 = 40^2 = 1600,\n\n(x - d)^2 + y^2 = 30^2 = 900.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n(x - c)^2 - (x - d)^2 = 1600 - 900 = 700.\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\n(x^2 - 2cx + c^2) - (x^2 - 2dx + d^2) = 700.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2cx + c^2 + 2dx - d^2 = 700.\n\nFactor:\n\n2x(d - c) + (c^2 - d^2) = 700.\n\nNote that c^2 - d^2 = -(d^2 - c^2) = -(d - c)(d + c). So substituting:\n\n2x(d - c) - (d - c)(d + c) = 700.\n\nFactor out (d - c):\n\n(d - c)(2x - (d + c)) = 700.\n\nSo, (d - c) * [2x - (d + c)] = 700.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of (d - c). Let's see if we can find that from the given distances.\n\nWe know that AC = c - a = 26,\n\nBD = d - b = 22,\n\nCE = e - c = 31,\n\nDF = f - d = 33,\n\nAF = f - a = 73.\n\nAlso, since the points are in order, we can relate these distances. Let's try to express variables in terms of a.\n\nLet me assign a coordinate system where A is at 0. Let's set a = 0. Then:\n\nFrom AF = 73, f = 73.\n\nFrom AC = 26, c = a + 26 = 0 + 26 = 26.\n\nFrom CE = 31, e = c + 31 = 26 + 31 = 57.\n\nFrom DF = 33, f = d + 33. But f is 73, so d = 73 - 33 = 40.\n\nSo d = 40.\n\nNow, BD = d - b = 22. Since d is 40, then b = d - 22 = 40 - 22 = 18.\n\nSo now we have coordinates:\n\na = 0,\n\nb = 18,\n\nc = 26,\n\nd = 40,\n\ne = 57,\n\nf = 73.\n\nNow, check if these satisfy all given distances:\n\nAC is 26 (from 0 to 26) ✔️.\n\nBD is 40 - 18 = 22 ✔️.\n\nCE is 57 - 26 = 31 ✔️.\n\nDF is 73 - 40 = 33 ✔️.\n\nAF is 73 - 0 = 73 ✔️.\n\nGreat, so all the distances check out.\n\nNow, back to the equation involving G.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\n(d - c) * [2x - (d + c)] = 700.\n\nWe have d = 40, c = 26. So d - c = 40 - 26 = 14.\n\nSo 14 * [2x - (40 + 26)] = 700.\n\nCompute 40 + 26 = 66.\n\nThus:\n\n14*(2x - 66) = 700.\n\nDivide both sides by 14:\n\n2x - 66 = 700 / 14 = 50.\n\nSo 2x = 50 + 66 = 116 → x = 58.\n\nSo x = 58. Now, we can find y from one of the distance equations. Let's use the equation for CG:\n\n(x - c)^2 + y^2 = 1600.\n\nx is 58, c is 26.\n\n(58 - 26)^2 + y^2 = 1600 → 32² + y² = 1600.\n\n32² is 1024. So y² = 1600 - 1024 = 576 → y = ±24.\n\nSo G is at (58, 24) or (58, -24). Since area is absolute, the sign of y won't matter. Let's take y = 24 for simplicity.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of triangle BGE. Coordinates of B, G, E.\n\nB is at 18 on the x-axis, so (18, 0).\n\nE is at 57 on the x-axis, so (57, 0).\n\nG is at (58, 24).\n\nThe area of triangle with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) can be found using the determinant formula:\n\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nx1 = 18, y1 = 0 (B)\n\nx2 = 58, y2 = 24 (G)\n\nx3 = 57, y3 = 0 (E)\n\nCompute:\n\nArea = |(18*(24 - 0) + 58*(0 - 0) + 57*(0 - 24))/2|\n\nSimplify:\n\n18*24 + 58*0 + 57*(-24) all over 2.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n18*24 = 432\n\n57*(-24) = -1368\n\nSum: 432 - 1368 = -936\n\nAbsolute value divided by 2: | -936 / 2 | = | -468 | = 468.\n\nSo the area is 468.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, since B and E are on the x-axis, the base of the triangle is BE, and the height is the y-coordinate of G.\n\nBE is the distance between B (18) and E (57), which is 57 - 18 = 39 units. The height is 24. Then area is (base * height)/2 = (39 * 24)/2 = 39 * 12 = 468. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo the area is 468. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{468}.\n</think>\n\n1. **Evaluated Difficulty of Questions**: 7  \n2. **Evidence of Difficulty Evaluation of Questions**: The level of difficulty is **intermediate** because it requires coordinate geometry, algebraic manipulation of distance equations, and application of area formulas.
