            "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is asking for the sum of all integer bases b greater than 9 where 17 in base b divides 97 in base b. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to convert both numbers from base b to decimal to understand the divisibility condition. Let's start with 17_b. In base b, the digits are 1 and 7, so that's 1*b + 7. Similarly, 97_b would be 9*b + 7. Wait, but hold on, in base b, the digits must be less than the base. Since the digits here are 9 and 7, the base must be greater than 9, which matches the condition given (b > 9). So that's good.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find all bases b > 9 such that (1*b + 7) divides (9*b + 7). Then sum all such bases.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. Let me denote the divisor as d = b + 7 and the dividend as N = 9b + 7. So, we need d | N, which means that N divided by d leaves no remainder. So, (9b + 7) / (b + 7) should be an integer.\n\nTo find when this division results in an integer, I can perform polynomial division or manipulate the expression to find conditions on b. Let me try algebraic manipulation.\n\nLet me write N = 9b + 7. Let me express this as a multiple of d plus a remainder. Let's divide 9b + 7 by b + 7.\n\nDividing 9b + 7 by b + 7:\n\nFirst term: 9b divided by b is 9. Multiply (b + 7) by 9: 9b + 63. Subtract this from N:\n\n(9b + 7) - (9b + 63) = 7 - 63 = -56.\n\nSo, the division gives 9 with a remainder of -56. Therefore, (9b + 7) = 9*(b + 7) - 56. Therefore, for (b + 7) to divide (9b + 7), the remainder must be zero. Therefore, -56 must be divisible by (b + 7). Which means that (b + 7) divides 56. But since we have a negative remainder, but divisibility is about absolute value, so (b + 7) must be a positive divisor of 56. However, since b > 9, then b + 7 must be greater than 9 + 7 = 16. So, we need to find all divisors of 56 that are greater than 16, and then subtract 7 to find the corresponding b.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The remainder is -56, which implies that (b + 7) divides 56. Because if we have N = q*d + r, and we want r = 0, then (b + 7) divides 56. So, the divisors of 56 are the numbers that can divide 56 without remainder. But since b + 7 must be positive (as b is a base >9), and greater than 16, as established.\n\nSo, first, let's list all positive divisors of 56. The prime factorization of 56 is 2^3 * 7^1. Therefore, the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. Now, we need divisors greater than 16. Looking at the list, those are 28 and 56.\n\nTherefore, b + 7 can be 28 or 56. Therefore, solving for b:\n\nIf b + 7 = 28, then b = 21.\n\nIf b + 7 = 56, then b = 49.\n\nSo, the possible bases are 21 and 49. Then, the sum is 21 + 49 = 70.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are other divisors. Wait, 56's divisors are indeed 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. So, the ones above 16 are 28 and 56. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any negative divisors. However, since b is a base, it must be a positive integer greater than 9, so b + 7 is positive. Therefore, we don't need to consider negative divisors.\n\nTherefore, the valid bases are 21 and 49, sum is 70. Let me verify with an example.\n\nTake b=21. Then 17_b is 1*21 +7=28. 97_b is 9*21 +7= 189 +7=196. 196 divided by 28 is 7, which is integer. Correct.\n\nFor b=49: 17_b is 1*49 +7=56. 97_b is 9*49 +7= 441 +7=448. 448 divided by 56 is 8, which is integer. Correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 21 +49=70. Therefore, the sum is 70.\n</think>\n\n1. **Evaluated Difficulty of Questions**: 7\n2. **Evidence of Difficulty Evaluation of Questions**: The level of difficulty is **intermediate** because it requires understanding base conversions, divisibility conditions, and solving for integer constraints involving divisors of a number (56). The problem involves algebraic manipulation and careful consideration of divisor properties.\n3. **Calibrate Explicit Reasoning Steps**: (1) Convert $17_b$ and $97_b$ to decimal: $17_b = b + 7$, $97_b = 9b + 7$. (2) Set up divisibility condition: $b + 7 \\mid 9b + 7$. (3) Perform division: $9b + 7 = 9(b + 7) - 56$, so $b + 7 \\mid 56$. (4) Find divisors of 56 greater than 16: 28, 56. (5) Solve $b + 7 = 28 \\Rightarrow b = 21$, $b + 7 = 56 \\Rightarrow b = 49$. (6) Sum valid bases: $21 + 49 = 70$.\n4. **Final Answer**: $\\boxed{70}$",

            "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have an isosceles trapezoid with an inscribed circle. The radius of the circle is 3, and the area of the trapezoid is 72. We need to find r² + s² where r and s are the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a trapezoid to have an inscribed circle (be tangential), the sum of the lengths of the two parallel sides must equal the sum of the two non-parallel sides. That's a key property. So, if the trapezoid is isosceles, the non-parallel sides are equal in length. Let me denote the lengths of the non-parallel sides as each being 'a'. Then, the condition for tangential trapezoid is r + s = 2a.\n\nNext, the area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: (1/2)*(r + s)*h, where h is the height. But since there's an inscribed circle, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the height of the trapezoid. Wait, the radius is 3, so the diameter is 6. Therefore, the height h is 6. Let me check that. Yes, because the circle is tangent to both bases, the distance between them (the height) must be twice the radius. So h = 2*3 = 6.\n\nGiven the area is 72, plugging into the area formula: 72 = (1/2)*(r + s)*6. Simplifying that, 72 = 3*(r + s), so r + s = 72 / 3 = 24. Therefore, r + s = 24.\n\nEarlier, we had from the tangential condition that r + s = 2a. So 2a = 24, which means a = 12. So each of the non-parallel sides is 12 units long.\n\nBut we need to find r² + s². We know that r + s = 24. To find r² + s², we can use the identity that r² + s² = (r + s)² - 2rs. So we need to find rs.\n\nHow can we find rs? Let's think. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are equal (which we have as 12 each), and the height is 6. The formula for the leg length in terms of the height and the difference of the bases. Let me recall that in an isosceles trapezoid, if you drop perpendiculars from the ends of the shorter base to the longer base, forming two right triangles on either side, the legs of these triangles are ( (r - s)/2 ) and the height h. So, the leg length a can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: a² = h² + [(r - s)/2]^2.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Let's assume that r is the longer base and s is the shorter one. Then, the difference in the bases is r - s. When you drop the perpendiculars, the horizontal segment between the two triangles is (r - s)/2 on each side. Therefore, the non-parallel side (which is 12) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs h (which is 6) and (r - s)/2. So:\n\na² = h² + [(r - s)/2]^2\n\nWe know a is 12, h is 6. Let's plug in:\n\n12² = 6² + [(r - s)/2]^2\n\n144 = 36 + [(r - s)/2]^2\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides:\n\n108 = [(r - s)/2]^2\n\nTake square roots:\n\nsqrt(108) = (r - s)/2\n\nSimplify sqrt(108): sqrt(36*3) = 6*sqrt(3). Therefore:\n\n6*sqrt(3) = (r - s)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nr - s = 12*sqrt(3)\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. r + s = 24\n2. r - s = 12√3\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find r and s. Let's add them:\n\n(r + s) + (r - s) = 24 + 12√3\n\n2r = 24 + 12√3\n\nr = 12 + 6√3\n\nThen, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(r + s) - (r - s) = 24 - 12√3\n\n2s = 24 - 12√3\n\ns = 12 - 6√3\n\nNow, compute r² + s². Let's compute each square:\n\nFirst, r = 12 + 6√3\n\nr² = (12)^2 + 2*12*6√3 + (6√3)^2 = 144 + 144√3 + 36*3 = 144 + 144√3 + 108 = 252 + 144√3\n\nSimilarly, s = 12 - 6√3\n\ns² = (12)^2 - 2*12*6√3 + (6√3)^2 = 144 - 144√3 + 108 = 252 - 144√3\n\nAdding them together:\n\nr² + s² = (252 + 144√3) + (252 - 144√3) = 252 + 252 = 504\n\nSo, the answer is 504. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, since r + s = 24 and r - s = 12√3, then r² + s² = (r + s)^2 - 2rs. Wait, but earlier I calculated it directly. Let me see if using that method gives the same result.\n\nWe have (r + s)^2 = 24² = 576. Then, we need to find rs.\n\nFrom r + s = 24 and r - s = 12√3, we can find rs.\n\nAlternatively, from the previous calculation, r = 12 + 6√3 and s = 12 - 6√3. So rs = (12)^2 - (6√3)^2 = 144 - 36*3 = 144 - 108 = 36. Therefore, r² + s² = (r + s)^2 - 2rs = 576 - 2*36 = 576 - 72 = 504. Yep, same result. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 504.\n</think>\n\n1. **Evaluated Difficulty of Questions**: 7  \n2. **Evidence of Difficulty Evaluation of Questions**: The level of difficulty is **intermediate** because it requires combining geometric properties (tangential trapezoid, inscribed circle) with algebraic manipulation and Pythagorean theorem.

            "model_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the setup. There are six points A, B, C, D, E, F on a straight line in that order. Point G is not on this line. We have several lengths given between these points: AC = 26, BD = 22, CE = 31, DF = 33, AF = 73. Also, CG = 40 and DG = 30. The goal is to find the area of triangle BGE.\n\nHmm. Since all points are colinear except G, maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's assume the line where A, B, C, D, E, F lie is the x-axis for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates to each point.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows: Let’s let point A be at position 0. Then, since AF = 73, point F is at 73. But we need to find the positions of B, C, D, E between A and F.\n\nGiven AC = 26, so the distance from A to C is 26. Since A is at 0, C is at 26.\n\nSimilarly, BD = 22. Let me think. Let me denote the positions of B, C, D, E. Let me define variables for their positions.\n\nLet me let the coordinates be:\n\nA: 0\n\nB: x\n\nC: 26 (since AC = 26)\n\nD: ?\n\nE: ?\n\nF: 73 (since AF = 73)\n\nBut BD = 22. Since B is at x and D is at some coordinate, say d. Then BD = |d - x| = 22.\n\nSimilarly, CE = 31. Since C is at 26, E is at 26 + 31 = 57? Wait, but CE is the distance from C to E, so if they are on a line, then E would be at 26 + 31 = 57. But wait, DF = 33. Since D is at some position, F is at 73, so DF = 73 - D's coordinate = 33. Therefore, D's coordinate is 73 - 33 = 40.\n\nWait, DF = 33, so D is at 73 - 33 = 40. So D is at 40. Then BD = 22. Since D is at 40, and B is at x, then |40 - x| = 22. Therefore, x = 40 - 22 = 18 or x = 40 + 22 = 62. But since the points are in order A, B, C, D, E, F, B must be before C (which is at 26). So if x is 62, that would be after C (26), which is not possible. Therefore, B must be at 18.\n\nSo B is at 18. Then, since C is at 26, BD is from B (18) to D (40) which is 22, correct.\n\nNow, CE = 31. C is at 26, so E is at 26 + 31 = 57. Then, since D is at 40, E is at 57, which is after D (40), which fits the order A(0), B(18), C(26), D(40), E(57), F(73). That seems correct.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nA: 0\n\nB: 18\n\nC: 26\n\nD: 40\n\nE: 57\n\nF: 73\n\nNow, we need to find the area of triangle BGE. But we need coordinates for G. We know CG = 40 and DG = 30. So point G is somewhere not on the line, and distances from C (26) and D (40) are 40 and 30 respectively.\n\nLet me think. Let me assign coordinates to G. Let me suppose that the line of A-F is the x-axis. Let me denote G as (x, y), where y ≠ 0.\n\nWe have the distance from G to C (26, 0) is 40:\n\n√[(x - 26)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 40 → (x - 26)^2 + y² = 1600 ...(1)\n\nSimilarly, distance from G to D (40, 0) is 30:\n\n√[(x - 40)^2 + y²] = 30 → (x - 40)^2 + y² = 900 ...(2)\n\nSubtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(x - 26)^2 - (x - 40)^2 = 1600 - 900 = 700\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\n(x² - 52x + 676) - (x² - 80x + 1600) = 700\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² -52x +676 -x² +80x -1600 = 700\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n( -52x +80x ) + (676 -1600) = 700\n\n28x - 924 = 700\n\n28x = 700 + 924 = 1624\n\nx = 1624 / 28\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: 406 / 7 = 58. So x = 58.\n\nWait, 28 * 58 = 28*(50 + 8) = 1400 + 224 = 1624. Yes. So x = 58.\n\nNow, plug x = 58 into equation (2):\n\n(58 - 40)^2 + y² = 900 → (18)^2 + y² = 900 → 324 + y² = 900 → y² = 576 → y = 24 or y = -24.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify where G is vertically, but area is absolute, so we can take y = 24 (assuming above the line).\n\nSo coordinates of G are (58, 24).\n\nNow, we have coordinates for B (18, 0), G (58, 24), and E (57, 0). Need to find the area of triangle BGE.\n\nTo find the area of triangle with coordinates, we can use the shoelace formula.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nB: (18, 0)\n\nG: (58, 24)\n\nE: (57, 0)\n\nShoelace formula:\n\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|\n\nPlugging in:\n\nx1 = 18, y1 = 0\n\nx2 = 58, y2 = 24\n\nx3 = 57, y3 = 0\n\nCompute:\n\n18*(24 - 0) + 58*(0 - 0) + 57*(0 - 24)\n\n= 18*24 + 58*0 + 57*(-24)\n\n= 432 + 0 - 1368\n\n= -936\n\nTake absolute value and divide by 2:\n\n| -936 | / 2 = 936 / 2 = 468\n\nSo the area is 468.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method to be sure. Alternatively, since points B and E are on the x-axis, the base BE can be calculated, and the height is the y-coordinate of G.\n\nWait, BE is from B (18,0) to E (57,0). The length of BE is 57 - 18 = 39. The height would be the vertical distance from G to the base BE, which is the y-coordinate of G, which is 24. Then area is (base * height)/2 = (39 * 24)/2 = (39 * 12) = 468. Yes, same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the area is 468.\n</think>\n\n1. **Evaluated Difficulty of Questions**: 7  \n2. **Evidence of Difficulty Evaluation of Questions**: The level of difficulty is **intermediate** because it requires setting up coordinate systems, solving systems of equations for point G, and applying geometry formulas like the shoelace formula or base-height area calculation.
